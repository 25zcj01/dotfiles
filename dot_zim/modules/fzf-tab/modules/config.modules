# Edit this file to change the way modules are loaded.
# The format is strict; do not break lines or add extra spaces.
# Run `make prep' if you change anything here after compiling
# (there is no need if you change this just after the first time
# you run `configure').
#
# Values of `link' are `static', `dynamic' or `no' to compile the
# module into the shell, link it in at run time, or not use it at all.
# In the final case, no attempt will be made to compile it.
# Use `static' or `no' if you do not have dynamic loading.
#
# Values of `load' are `yes' or `no'; if yes, any builtins etc.
# provided by the module will be autoloaded by the main shell
# (so long as `link' is not set to `no').
#
# Values of `auto' are `yes' or `no'. configure sets the value to
# `yes'.  If you set it by hand to `no', the line will be retained
# when the file is regenerated in future.
#
# Note that the `functions' entry extends to the end of the line.
# It should not be quoted; it is used verbatim to find files to install.
#
# You will need to run `config.status --recheck' if you add a new
# module.
#
# You should not change the values for the pseudo-module zsh/main,
# which is the main shell (apart from the functions entry).
