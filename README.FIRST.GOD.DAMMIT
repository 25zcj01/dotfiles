Most of this should be self-contained without any external help needed.
That being said, the following tools make it a bit smoother (and won't break aliases):

    • exa
    • fzf
    • zoxide
    • a terminal with 24-bit colour support
    • fd
    • bat
    • moar

Ideally I'd update this as new stuff pops up, but no promises

Good luck, future self
